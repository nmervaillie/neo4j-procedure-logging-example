= Neo4j logging in procedure example

This project illustrates how to do logging in a Neo4j custom procedure / function,
and control the logging activation dynamically at runtime using `CALL dbms.setConfigValue`.

It uses the enterprise edition as community edition does not support changing configuration at runtime.
You'll need to configure your maven settings to add the Neo4j enterprise maven repository (see pom file for more details).
